    <p>What, would you say, is going on with this United Airlines cocktail napkin?</p>

    <p>Surely there are combinations of United destination cities that, when arranged in a monospaced table, neatly spell out "CHEERS" in a vertical column.<sup>*</sup></p>
    
    <p>As it turns out, there are many such combinations! I calculated them by grabbing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Airlines_destinations">a list of United Airlines destinations</a> (excluding regional partner flights) and <a href="https://github.com/cjwinchester/cheers">working it out with some Python</a>.</p>

    <p>Anyway, here are some alternative napkin designs:</p>

      <p><sup>*</sup>"San Francisco" doesn't include an exclamation point, but at any rate I don't think United flies to any of the handful of <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data">domestic</a> or <a href="https://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/index.html">foreign</a> cities whose names include exclamation points.</p>
